<p class="heading">Hello, and welcome to my Personal Website. I am here to tell you about it and myself. My name is Jerica Hanna and I hope to become an amazing programmer.
    I am pursing my education journey at indian hills community college. Where my curiousity and passion for coding sky rocketed. I've always been on the computer
    ever since I was young. There were just too many things I hadn't discovered. It's a life long fasination thats has driven me to explore more.
    I can't wait to learn even more lanaguages and just learn about the online world in general. Whether I'm diving into the depths of a new subject, 
    embarking on an adventure in the physical world, or simply surfing the web, this website is my ticket to learning, progressing, and overall just here to improve!
    If you ever want to learn more about me, heard over to my contact page and you can talk to me through any of those websites I linked for you.
